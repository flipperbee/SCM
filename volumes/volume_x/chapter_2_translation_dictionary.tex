\chapter{The Translation Dictionary} \label{chapter-translation-dictionary}

In order to formally demonstrate that Yang--Mills theory is an emergent approximation of SCM, we must construct a precise mapping between their key mathematical objects.

This chapter defines a structural correspondence between classical gauge field constructs and symbolic structures in the SCM framework.

\section{Overview of the Correspondence}

Let us begin with a side-by-side mapping of core quantities:

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Coherence Field and Symbolic Curvature}

\begin{definition}[Symbolic Coherence Field]
Let $[A] \in \Omega_3$ be a resolved identity with return path set $\mathcal{R}([A])$. The \textbf{coherence field} at $[A]$ is:
\[
\Phi([A]) := \sum_{i} p_i \Lambda(\mathcal{L}_i)
\]
where $p_i$ is the normalized probability of return path $\mathcal{L}_i$ and $\Lambda(\mathcal{L}_i)$ is its effort-weighted latency.
\end{definition}

This scalar field $\Phi([A])$ governs symbolic evolution, just as the potential $A_\mu(x)$ governs field evolution in gauge theory.

\begin{definition}[Symbolic Curvature]
Let $\chi([A]) = (X_h, X_c, X_\pi, X_\phi, X_\epsilon)$ be the coherence signature of $[A]$. The symbolic curvature is the second-order change in coherence potential:
\[
\mathcal{K}([A]) := \nabla \nabla \Phi(\chi([A]))
\]
\end{definition}

This plays the structural role of the classical field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$.

\section{Contradiction Functional vs. Field Lagrangian}

In Yang--Mills theory, the Lagrangian density is:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{YM} = -\frac{1}{4} \text{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu})
\]

In SCM, we define an equivalent structural quantity:

\begin{definition}[Contradiction Functional]
Let $R$ be a Rule Set and $[A] \in \Omega_3(R)$. The total contradiction of the system is:
\[
\mathcal{C}[R] := \sum_{[A]} \left( 1(\vec{\partial \chi}([A]) \neq 0) + 1(\rho([A]) < \rho_c) + 1(X_\pi([A]) \to \pm 1) \right)
\]
\end{definition}

This contradiction functional plays the same role as a classical energy: high $\mathcal{C}$ means unstable or incoherent symbolic configurations.

\section{Return-Invariance as Gauge Symmetry}

\begin{definition}[Return-Invariance]
A Rule Set $R$ is return-invariant over identity $[A]$ if all transformations $T \in R$ that preserve $[A]$ form closed loops in $\mathcal{R}([A])$, and modifying any $T_i$ in the loop yields $\mathcal{C}[R'] \geq \mathcal{C}[R]$.
\end{definition}

This structural invariance defines the symmetry of the system under symbolic evolution. In the continuum limit, this corresponds to gauge invariance.

\section{Latency and the Mass Gap}

In classical gauge theory, the mass gap is an assumed property of the energy spectrum:
\[
E_0 = 0,\quad E_1 \geq \Delta > 0
\]

In SCM, this is a provable structural fact:

\begin{definition}[Symbolic Mass Gap]
The mass gap in SCM is the minimal latency required for a persistent identity to exist:
\[
\Lambda_0 := \min \{ \Lambda([A]) \mid [A] \in \Omega_3 \}
\]
\end{definition}

In both systems, excitations must overcome this floor to exist. But only SCM provides the \emph{reason}.

\section{Conclusion: A Precise Structural Analogy}

We summarize:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_\mu(x)$ is the approximation of $\Phi(\chi)$.
    \item $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the projection of $\nabla\nabla \Phi$.
    \item Gauge invariance is symbolic return-invariance.
    \item Energy minimization is contradiction minimization.
    \item The mass gap is not a hypothesis---it is a topological requirement.
\end{itemize}

This dictionary now allows us to construct the argument, in the rest of the volume, that classical Yang--Mills theory is the smooth shadow of symbolic coherence topology.
