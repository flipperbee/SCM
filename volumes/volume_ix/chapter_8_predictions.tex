\chapter{Cosmological Observables and Falsifiable Predictions} \label{chapter:cosmological-predictions}

A foundational theory must make testable predictions. SCM, grounded in symbolic return and Eulerian coherence, leads to a set of falsifiable consequences. These are not speculative—they are derived from structural dynamics and phase geometry.

\section{Quantized Redshift Shells}

Let $[A]$ and $[B]$ be identities undergoing symbolic drift. Return quantization implies:

\[
\Delta z \in \mathbb{Q}
\quad \text{where } z = \frac{\Lambda([B]) - \Lambda([A])}{\Lambda([A])}
\]

This predicts discrete redshift steps, particularly in coherent filaments:
- Non-random banding of redshift data,
- Sharp edges in void-boundary shell transitions.

\paragraph{Test:} Search for statistically significant quantization in large-scale galaxy surveys (e.g. SDSS, DESI).

\section{Tunneling Anisotropies and Horizon Crossings}

Quantum tunneling corresponds to coherence traversing symbolic contradiction gradients. In SCM:

\[
\text{Tunneling} \iff \exists \mathcal{L}_{\text{nonlocal}} \text{ with } \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{L}) < \mathcal{C}_{\text{local}}
\]

This predicts:
- Horizon-violating coherence echoes,
- Anisotropic phase interference aligned with contradiction topology.

\paragraph{Test:} Look for angular non-uniformities in CMB or neutrino background not explainable by inflation or foreground structure.

\section{Coherence Echoes in Void Collapse}

Voids are structurally pruned contradiction scars. SCM predicts:
- Delayed re-use structures at void boundaries,
- Echoes of prior coherence fields re-anchored across reuse ladders.

\paragraph{Test:} Detect recurrent spectral signatures or coherence-preserving lensing across void interiors.

\section{Reframing Dark Energy}

In SCM, accelerated expansion is not caused by vacuum pressure—it results from symbolic overload collapse:

\[
\partial \chi \uparrow,\quad P([A]) \to 1 \Rightarrow \text{reuse chain truncation}
\]

This predicts:
- Expansion is quantized and tied to return lattice failure,
- No new mass-energy is required.

\paragraph{Test:} Look for coherence-correlated expansion irregularities—sharp shifts in structure growth rate without accompanying energy density increase.

\section{Asymmetric Drift in Polarized Regions}

Coherence regions under unbalanced $X_\pi$ will produce directional structure:
- Anisotropic filament alignment,
- Persistent angular momentum across independent clusters.

\paragraph{Test:} Search for long-range parity violations or rotational coherence in high redshift environments.

\section{Low-Energy Triplet Instabilities}

Reuse triplets near $\Lambda_0$ may not stabilize. This implies:
- Mass gaps in allowed particle families,
- Rare suppression of light neutral structures (e.g., light sterile neutrinos).

\paragraph{Test:} Look for missing or statistically suppressed triplet modes in neutrino oscillation datasets or early structure formation.

\section{Return-Induced Quantization of Expansion}

Coherence ladder expansion implies:

\[
\Delta \Lambda = n \cdot \Delta_0
\Rightarrow \text{expansion proceeds in discrete coherence epochs}
\]

This structure suggests:
- CMB imprints at reuse discontinuities,
- Epoch-linked jump features in Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).

\paragraph{Test:} Identify hidden quantization in BAO and CMB phase alignment spectra.

\section{Final Statement}

SCM is not just internally coherent—it is externally falsifiable. The theory predicts structure, anisotropy, and quantization in cosmological data, rooted not in geometry, but in the symbolic coherence of return and contradiction.

With this volume, the SCM framework completes its arc: from abstract symbolic logic to spacetime, quantum structure, and observable universe. Its foundation is not conjecture, but the phase-locked truth encoded in Euler’s formula.
