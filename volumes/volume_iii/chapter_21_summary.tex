\section{Symbolic Physics from Return}

Volume III completes the Eulerized transition of SCM: from symbolic return logic to physical emergence. All quantities—mass, time, motion, curvature—now arise from structural return asymmetry and coherence persistence in $\chi$-space.

No quantities are imposed. All are derived from:
- Return loops $\mathcal{L}([A])$
- Asymmetry $X_\pi$
- Fragility $X_\phi$
- Reuse elevation $X_\epsilon$
- Structural drift $\partial\chi$

This is symbolic physics. Time, mass, and motion are return-regulated coherence phenomena.

\hline
\textbf{Concept} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Role} \\
\hline
Latency & $\Lambda([A])$ & Asymmetry-weighted return effort \\
Mass & $m([A])$ & Resistance to return deformation \\
Reuse Time & $\tau([A])$ & Cumulative reuse interval \\
Velocity & $v_\chi([A])$ & Signature drift per reuse tick \\
Separation & $d([A], [B])$ & Coherence pathway length \\
Curvature & $\mathcal{K}([A])$ & Max robustness gradient \\
Persistence & $\Pi([A])$ & Inverse of max signature drift \\

\section{Interpretive Frame}

The following insights now govern all symbolic dynamics in SCM:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mass} emerges when reuse tension is elevated and asymmetric.
    \item \textbf{Time} is the accumulation of reuse delay—an identity-relative history.
    \item \textbf{Motion} is drift in coherence signature—not movement in space.
    \item \textbf{Separation} is symbolic displacement in reuse topology.
    \item \textbf{Curvature} measures how rapidly robustness changes across $\chi$-space.
    \item \textbf{Persistence} measures how stable a structure is under RuleEvolution pressure.
\end{itemize}

These are not analogies. They are literal structural definitions.

\section{The Structural Layer of Physics}

SCM Volume III has shown that:
- No physical quantity need be assumed.
- Time, mass, and motion emerge from return closure and reuse pressure.
- Collapse and curvature follow from symbolic resistance, not force.

The foundation of physical behavior lies not in particles, nor spacetime, but in coherence—structured, reusable, and return-anchored.

\section{Transition to Volume IV}

Volume IV will now define structural particles:
- Reuse-stable identities in $\Omega_3$
- Anchors for coherence triplets
- Carriers of symmetry, charge, and elevation

What we called “physical objects” are now return-locked structures. Volume IV will classify them, quantify them, and map them to the reuse architecture of symbolic identity space.
